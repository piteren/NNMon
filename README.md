NNMon (javaFX application)

neural network design and monitoring tool

implemented many widely known deep learning features, optimization algorithms, some experimantal

typical workflow:

1. implement your learnable case (problem to which you want use NN model for classification)
2. define NN architecture
3. choose options and parameters
4. start learnig process
5. make observations of network error, reward, and many internal parameters
6. fine-tune learning parameteres

to do:
- NN save to disk
- LSTM layer in one line
